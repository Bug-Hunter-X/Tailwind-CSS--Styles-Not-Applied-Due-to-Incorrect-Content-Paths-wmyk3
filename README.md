# Tailwind CSS Configuration Issue: Missing Styles

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when setting up Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied due to incorrectly specified file paths in the `content` option of the `tailwind.config.js` file.

## Problem

The provided `tailwind.config.js` (in the `bug` directory) has an incorrect path in the `content` array, causing Tailwind to miss the necessary HTML, JSX, or TSX files where classes are used.  This results in styles not being applied to the elements in the application.

## Solution

The corrected `tailwind.config.js` (in the `bugSolution` directory) fixes the path to correctly include all relevant files containing Tailwind classes.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to the `bug` directory
3. Run the necessary Tailwind CSS commands (e.g., `npx tailwindcss init`)
4. Observe that the styles are not being applied
5. Navigate to the `bugSolution` directory
6. Repeat step 3; this time, the styles will be correctly applied
